The Democratic field, divided and without a clear frontrunner in the early days, has coalesced around well-known civil rights activist and current 20-year Atlanta Congressman Martin Luther King Jr. <p>If elected, Martin Luther King Jr will be the first African-American President of the United States, and would be quite liberal too. For those reasons, some may believe that President Bush, in spite of his broken promises and immense party fatigue could hold on for another four-year term for the Republican Party. The 1992 election is expected to be one of the most fascinating races in many years, due to all of the peculiar factors of this race. </p>",

He is regarded as the leader of the Civil Rights movement, making powerful speeches such as his \"I Have a Dream\" and \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" speeches, as well as writing his \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\". After surviving multiple assassination attempts, he began his political career in 1972 taking Georgia's 5th Congressional district, serving the Atlanta area ever since. He has fought for economic and racial equality throughout his years in public service. In order to win the election, he will likely need to moderate on some issues, or hope enough people get tired of the 12-year Republican rule. Either way, many expect a heavy lift for MLK to make his Dream complete and become the first African-American president of the United States.</p>",

He is particularly strong on economic issues, and is credited for leading one of the most dramatic economic turnarounds in the history of state government in Michigan. He is also very strong on economic protectionism, which could help with blue-collar workers. If you want to run on the economy, James Blanchard could be one of the best choices for that. Furthermore, Michigan is expected to be one of the most competitive states in this election, and his geographical advantage could prove to be vital there, as well as in the rest of the Midwest.</p>",
